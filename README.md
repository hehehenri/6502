# 6502 CPU Emulator

## Overview

This project is a simple 6502 CPU emulator implemented in Rust.

## Why

The primary motivation behind building this emulator is to gain a deeper understanding of how a simple processor works. 

## Features

- **Emulation:** The emulator provides a cycle-accurate simulation of the 6502 CPU.
- **Memory:** Simulates RAM and ROM to provide a realistic execution environment.
- **Instructions:** Implements a subset of 6502 instructions for basic functionality.

### Building
